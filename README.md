# AutoInland-Vehicle-Insurance-Claim-Challenge
The data describes ~12,000 policies sold by AutoInland for car insurance. Information on the car type, make, customer age and start of policy are in the data.  The objective of this hackathon is to develop a predictive model that determines if a customer will submit a claim within 3 months from their first transaction.
